#CHAT GPT EXPLANATION

Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

Import the annotate function from the rough-notation library.

Add a listener for when the page loads.

Define the annotations to be used on the page using an object with keys that represent the annotation type and values that specify the annotation's properties such as color, type, and animation settings.

Check if the browser supports the IntersectionObserver API. If not, the function exits and no annotations will be displayed.

Define the configuration options for the IntersectionObserver object, which will be used to observe the target elements.

Initialize an IntersectionObserver object that takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function will be triggered when the target elements intersect with the viewport.

Iterate through each target element on the page and add it to the IntersectionObserver object to observe for changes.

When the target element intersects with the viewport, the callback function is triggered. It retrieves the annotationType from the target element's data-notation-type attribute and initializes the annotation with the corresponding configuration properties from the annotations object.

If the target element is intersecting with the viewport, the annotation is displayed and the observer stops observing the target element. If the target element is no longer intersecting with the viewport, an action can be added to handle this scenario.
